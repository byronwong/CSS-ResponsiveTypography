		Proportion: One size won't rule them all
		========================================

		// Design is about comunicating idea and influencing behaviour
		// Use scale as a starting point & tweak for specfic typefaces and usage scenarios
		// Much like the grid: this is not relagion, it's just a start

		// Please read:
		http://typecast.com/blog/a-more-modern-scale-for-web-typography
		http://typecast.com/seminars/rwd

		// Each type face will render better at certian sizes, this is because the typeface designer designed it for certain sizes
