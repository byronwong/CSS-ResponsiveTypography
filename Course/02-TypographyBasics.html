		What is typography
		==================

		- Choosing typefaces that relate to your client/ project
		- Specifying type that enhances your design and amplifies message and meaning
		- Even Better: Setting type in a way that helps to convey meaning and intent whereever it is seen


		// Look at example to what the client is doing and what is the trend in the industry, country etc.
		// thick or thin strokes can be hard to read on small screens

		// Trade gothic / franklin gothic / news gothic 
		// ITC Lubalin graph + advant garde
		// fonts.com
		// webtype.com

		// NOTE: the more points to make a font the larger the font


		// Tone: formal (trajan, times) vs informal ()
		// History: what was the style during that time
		// Origin/ Ethnic Relationship
		// Intended use


		Type Pairing 
		============
		- match qualities (oval/round, wide/ tall, thick/thin)
		- this takes the most time to develop 'feel'
		- 'type is the clothes the words wear'


		From paper to pixel
		===================
		- know what translates
		- rendering will always be different
		- content will change - often
		- canvas size will always be changing
		- there are no fixed points or proportions - think more relative
